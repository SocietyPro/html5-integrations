html5-integrations
==================

Manage integrations between third party apps and your SOAPI server

Developer Usage
---------------

Prerequisites: nodejs and npm and grunt

    $ npm install -g grunt

    $ git clone https://github.com/SocietyPro/html5-integrations.git
    $ npm install
    $ grunt

This gruntfile (at the moment) only installs bower components (including angular-material).
